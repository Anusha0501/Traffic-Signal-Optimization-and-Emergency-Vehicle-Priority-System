# 🚦 Traffic Signal Optimization & Emergency Vehicle Priority System

A simulation-based intelligent traffic signal control system that dynamically manages vehicle flow using real-time YOLO-based vehicle detection and prioritizes emergency vehicles. Built with Python, Pygame, OpenCV, and ESP32 (via Wokwi simulation), and integrated using MQTT.

## 📌 Features

- 🚘 **YOLOv2-based Vehicle Detection**: Real-time vehicle recognition and lane-wise traffic density analysis.
- ⏱️ **Adaptive Signal Timing**: Dynamically adjusts green light durations based on lane traffic.
- 🚑 **Emergency Vehicle Priority**: Detects ambulances/fire trucks and grants immediate right-of-way.
- 🧵 **Multithreading**: Ensures responsive simulation without blocking detection or UI.
- 📡 **MQTT Communication**: ESP32 microcontroller subscribes to signal data for real-time LED control.
- 🔁 **Pygame Simulation**: Interactive GUI representing a 4-way intersection with live vehicle movement.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### ▶️ Python Simulation

```bash
python main.py
```

* Launches a Pygame-based simulation window.
* Captures frames, detects vehicles, and sends lane data over MQTT.

### 🔌 ESP32 Setup

* Open `esp32_traffic.ino` in the Arduino IDE.
* Set your WiFi SSID and password.
* Upload to an ESP32 board (or simulate using [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/)).
* Connects to the MQTT broker (`broker.hivemq.com`) and controls LED signals.
